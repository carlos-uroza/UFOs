# Module 11 Challenge - UFO Sightings with JavaScript

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to build a program that can filter a javascript data file and present the results on a customized webpage. The webpage serves as the visual interface for the user to apply a variety of simultaneous user defined filters and view the results.

## Results

### Deliverable 1: Filter UFO sightings on multiple criteria - Search Instructions

1. In order to perferm a search, a client would simply input the desired search criteria in the corresponding input boxes.
2. There is no need to click a search button as our webpage uses D3 event handles to listen to any changes on the input fields, adjusting the filters automatically.
3. Our javascript file, app.js, will then save the user imputs and only display the matching results on the custom webpage.

## Summary

### Drawback of Webpage Format

A drawback to note, would be that our data filters only allow to filter for an individual date. It would be more usefull to filter with relations to an entire user defined date range. This would allow the user to evaluate UFO sightings on a weekly or monthly basis.

### Recommendations

Our program could be further improved by allowing users to refined their searches based on multiple possible locations. This could be achieved by allowing the user to imput multiple states or selecting from a drop down menu.
Another improvement would be to allow to save or export their filtered results for use in their own analysis.
